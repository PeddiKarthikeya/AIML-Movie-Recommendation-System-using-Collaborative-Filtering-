Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering and SVD:

Overview
This project is a movie recommendation system built using the recommenderlab package in R. It utilizes Collaborative Filtering and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict movie ratings and provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences. The goal is to suggest movies that a user is likely to enjoy based on their historical ratings and the ratings of similar users.

->Project Description
This recommendation system uses Collaborative Filtering to analyze user-item interactions and predict ratings for unseen movies. The system uses Matrix Factorization (SVD) to handle sparse data and to provide more accurate recommendations by breaking down the user-item matrix into smaller components. The workflow is as follows:
Load the MovieLense dataset.
Preprocess the data (explore, visualize, and split into training and test sets).
Apply Collaborative Filtering to build a recommendation model.
Use SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to fill in missing ratings and improve recommendation accuracy.
Evaluate the model using metrics like ROC Curve and Top-N Recommendations.

->Installation Instructions
*To run the recommendation system, you need R and the necessary libraries installed.
Clone the Repository First, clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MovieRecommendationSystem.git
cd MovieRecommendationSystem
*Install Required Libraries You need to install the following R libraries:
install.packages("recommenderlab")
install.packages("ggplot2")
*Load the Dataset This project uses the MovieLense dataset, which is available in the recommenderlab package by default. No additional download is required.

->How It Works
1. Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is the first step in building the recommendation system. It is a method used to predict user preferences based on past behaviors (ratings, interactions, etc.). There are two main types:
*User-based Collaborative Filtering: Finds similar users and recommends items they have rated highly.
*Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Finds items that are similar to those the user has rated highly and recommends them.
2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
SVD is used to factorize the user-item interaction matrix into three smaller matrices. It helps reduce the dimensionality of the matrix and allows the system to predict missing ratings (for movies the user has not yet rated). This improves recommendation accuracy and makes the system handle sparse data better.
3. Model Building
In the script, we:
*Preprocess the MovieLense dataset (splitting it into training and test sets).
*Train a Collaborative Filtering model using the training data.
*Apply Matrix Factorization (SVD) to predict ratings and generate recommendations.
4. Evaluating the Model
To assess the quality of the recommendations:
We use an evaluation scheme with the evaluationScheme function.
Top-N Recommendations: We generate the top 5 movies for each user.
ROC Curve: We visualize the performance using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

->Dataset
This project uses the MovieLense dataset from the recommenderlab package, which contains movie ratings by users. The dataset includes:
Users: Represented by rows in the matrix.
Movies: Represented by columns.
Ratings: Numerical values indicating the rating given by a user to a movie.
Important Notes:
The dataset is sparse (many missing values).
The dataset used in the script is already included in the recommenderlab package. If needed, you can download the MovieLens dataset from MovieLens website.

->Running the Script
After cloning the repository and installing the required packages, you can run the R script as follows:
*Open the R environment (RStudio or a similar IDE).
*Open the recommendation_script.R file.
*Run the script step-by-step or execute the whole script to generate recommendations.
The script does the following:
*Loads the MovieLense dataset.
*Preprocesses the data (explores sparsity and visualizes ratings).
*Splits the data into training and testing sets.
*Trains a collaborative filtering model (using SVD for matrix factorization).
*Generates top 5 recommendations for each user.
*Evaluates the model and plots the ROC curve.

->Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the recommendation model:
Top-N Recommendations: The system provides the top 5 movies recommended for each user.
ROC Curve: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is plotted to visualize how well the model distinguishes between good and bad ratings.

->Performance Metrics:
The ROC curve helps assess the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
Precision and Recall can be calculated for further evaluation (optional).
